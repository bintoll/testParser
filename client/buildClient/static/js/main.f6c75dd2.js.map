Так же закончил Британский банковско-финансовый колледж по программе BTEC First Certificate/Diploma in Business. Уровень знания английского языка 6 IELTS. Програмированием занимаюсь со старших классов школы. Начинал с python. Далее увлекся программирование микроконтроллеров avr - C/C++. После этого заинтресовался написанием приложений для ios - Objective-c. Далее был перерерыв, только иногда писал код для себя, из-за учебы. Так же пару раз сталкивался со swift, C#, java. После, увлекся web разработкой = php. Достаточно большое время использовал этот язык. После открыл для себя javascript. Сейчас стараюсь заниматься разработкой только на этом языке, потому что он мне очень симпатичен.</p>  \n              <p className=\"text\">Мои хобби включают в себя катание на велосипеде, игра в настольный теннис, катание на сноуборде, иногда, берусь снова за микроконтроллеры, так же интересен тюнинг автомобилей.
